# Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
#
# For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
#
# a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:
#
#     3
#    / \
#   9  20
#     /  \
#    15   7
# Return true.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:
#
#        1
#       / \
#      2   2
#     / \
#    3   3
#   / \
#  4   4
# Return false.
